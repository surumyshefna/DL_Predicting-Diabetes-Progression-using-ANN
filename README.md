# DL_Predicting-Diabetes-Progression-using-ANN
The model is the progression of diabetes using the available independent variables. This model will help healthcare professionals understand how different factors influence the progression of diabetes and potentially aid in designing better treatment plans and preventive measures. The model will provide insights into the dynamics of diabetes progression in patients.

Dataset:
Use the Diabetes dataset available in the sklearn library.

Key components to be fulfilled :

1.Loading and Preprocessing 
Load the Diabetes dataset from sklearn.
Handle any missing values if present.
Normalize the features to ensure better performance of the ANN model.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Perform EDA to understand the distribution of features and the target variable.
Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable.

3.Building the ANN Model 
Design a simple ANN architecture with at least one hidden layer.
Use appropriate activation functions .

4.Training the ANN Model 
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training data.
Use an appropriate loss function and optimizer.

5.Evaluating the Model 
Evaluate the model on the testing data.
Report the performance metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, RÂ² Score).

6.Improving the Model 
Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, or hyperparameters to improve the model performance.
Report the changes made and the corresponding improvement in performance.
